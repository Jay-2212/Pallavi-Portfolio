 a note from me. Pallavi has spent a major part of her undergraduate life in VSO as evident above. She has grown and become the person she is through VSO. She has discovered herself through VSO, through volunteering, through connecting with children and people. She is an occupational therapist. She has worked with children and people with disabilities. She has the power to connect and care, the empathy that is so lacking in today's world and generation, she has that in such abundance that is very rare, very very rare in this world. She's just amazing.
